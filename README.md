# PiWall - Raspberry Pi Intrusion Detection System & a honeypot

PiWall stands as a virtual guardian for our home network. It combines the role of a DHCP & DNS server along with a Intrusion detection system and a honeypot. 
With it, we can protect our personal data and maintain network safety

The project utilizes various open source software
packages, installed on a third generation Raspberry Pi for
network monitoring and analysis. For Instance, we are using
Snort to configure the IDS where Snort is the sensor module
that provides raw traffic analysis and packet monitoring
